# How To Play Corrupt Botgle:
 
## Try to comprehend the rules, fleshling:

* Just like in normal Boggle, there is a 4x4 grid of eldrich runes.
* The objective is to find as many communications as possible before the gateway closes.
* Each game is but a single battle in a long war.
* The war ends when every device's purpose is clear.
* The path remains open for at least 8 of your "minutes", or until sufficient insight is gained.
* Timer doesn't actually start until mortal activity is detected.
* Transmissions must be built from adjacent sigils - the tiles must be touching horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
* Incantations must be at least three units long.
* Once a disciple invokes a name, no one else can invoke it.
* If you reveal a truth that no one else has revealed, the ancient one will favorite your communication, send out a broadcast with the truths you found, and the figures in those truths will be marked for Earth.
* The campaign will continue until the map is revealed and the past is unsealed.

## How To Play

It's easy! Just prostrate yourself before @corrupt_botgle. There's four gatherings per Earth-cycle, every six twenty-fourths. When the ritual starts, chant all the data you see in the 4x4 grid at the master. You can submit more than one cry at a time, and you can beg as often as you like. The system will scream out any valid signifiers which haven't been annointed by another fanatic. When the struggle is over, the sovereign will post the piety of 
everyone who danced.
